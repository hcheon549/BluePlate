        <p>At BluePlattr, the health and well-being of our users, and communities is our top priority. We understand the concern and uncertainty you may be experiencing surrounding the coronavirus (COVID-19) and we are committed to being responsive to the needs of our users as the situation evolves.</p>
        <p>In order to address the University's recent announcement regarding the coronavirus, we have decided to <strong>extend everyone's subscription until the end of the semester.</strong> This means the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>- Your meal credits are redeemable at any of the restaurants on BluePlattr until the end of the semester.</li>
          <li>- You will not be charged for any renewal.</li>
          <li>- You will be able to purchase additional meal credits that you can redeem by the end of the semester if you need it in the future when on-site classes resume.</li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>
        <p>Should you find yourself in need of assistance, please contact us by email at <a href="mailto:support@blueplattr.com">support@blueplattr.com.</a></p>
        <p>As always, the health, safety, and well-being of our users and our communities is of paramount concern. We will continue to monitor this quickly evolving situation and are here to assist our users as needed.</p>
        <p>I hope you and your family stay safe amid this global pandemic.</p>
